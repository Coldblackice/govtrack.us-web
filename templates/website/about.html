	<h2><span>What you can do on GovTrack</span></h2>

	<p>Use GovTrack to track bills for updates by <a href="/start">getting alerts</a> and understand the broader context of legislation through our <a href="/about/analysis">statistical analyses</a>. Read our original research on <a href="https://govtrackinsider.com">GovTrack Insider</a> and in our <a href="/misconduct">congressional misconduct database</a>.</p>

	<p>You can read more about <a href="/about-our-data">the data we have</a>, including how you can get it. GovTrack was the first to create comprehensive open data about Congress, and we have successfully lobbied Congress to make more and better legislative information available to the public.</p>

<p>b. We never misrepresent or exclude information to favor one side. We never side for or against any policy, politician, or organization â€” except policies that further our mission as described in this charter.</p>
<p>c. We do not accept grants from partisan organizations. Our advertising space is made available to all advertisers without regard to political views.</p>
